                            <p class="drop-cap">Arguably no mechanism in our world has more influence over the wellbeing of our society than how we manage our money, or how it is managed for us. Wise management leads to prosperity and freedom, while mismanagement leads to stagnation and slavery.</p>

                            <p>This is something every prosperous household or business operator knows, accounting for every dollar to be put towards the values and goals of the whole. So too in an ideal world that would be the case for our global economy.</p>
                            
                            <p>But that is not the economy we live in.</p>
                            
                            <p>Human worth, our natural resources and biosphere, prosperity, sustainability, self-sufficiency, fairness, democracy, life! are all sacrificed in the relentless drive of our global economy, while those that operate our systems of money, the axis of our economy, do not behave in the best interests of everyone, but rather leverage society for their own profit and advantage.</p>
                            
                            <p>I certainly know that new money (bank loans) injected into my money supply does not profit me, nor do the many bubble-bust cycles along the way. Quite the opposite, their gain is my decline.</p>
                            
                            <p>It often appears we have created a system designed to work against itself. An ode to a generation (or two) who wanted to see how far the idea of free-market economics, divorced from societal wellbeing, could be pushed before someone said: “Hold up, hold up, what you’re’ doing directly affects me”, to which the reply is “that’s just how it works”.</p>
                            
                            <p>To me, this reflects a systemic misalignment with our money and humanity as a whole. To better realise our social and economic ideals it stands to reason we need a monetary system that supports them, right? This may sound idealistic, and simplistic, but this is an idealistic and simple article, so please keep reading.</p>

                            <p>Our economic issues are not accidents, nor are they symptoms of base human nature. They are inevitable consequences from a wayward structure of management.</p>

                            <p>In this article, I want to discuss the idea of value through five common-sense truths or maxims. My goal is to illustrate how every economic woe we face today has its roots in misaligned value systems that are systemically perpetuated by our system of money, and the only path that leads our generation to a sustainable end is one that addresses this shortfall!</p>
                            
                            <p>Let's begin.

                                    Therefore, to increase wealth, the earth and each other should be valued above all. <b> But paradoxically, we find value in activities that destroy and marginalise both.</b></p>
                                
                                    <p> The <a href="">climate emergency</a> is on our doorstep. 
                                        Our oceans are degraded more each year from plastic and pollution.
                                        On our current trajectory, we will destroy <a href="">all sea life in the next 50 years</a>, and by the close of this century we’ll have harvested 100% of <a href="">all rainforests</a> and exterminated <a href="">over half of all species</a> on our planet.</P>

                                <P>
                                    Similarly, our economies displace workers and lower wages for efficiency, stifle innovation to protect market titans, devalue local productivity to exploit cheaper labour across the border, and exponentially grow debt while devaluing our savings in the name of growth.</P>
                                    
                                    <p>Squeezing margins and cutting corners to maximise returns is such a reasonable philosophy within our current social and economic landscape! How often have we heard it said that it’s the fiduciary responsibility of a company to maximise shareholder wealth?</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Without vilifying any specific group or sector, we cannot escape the fact that we have perpetuated, intentionally or unwittingly, a system of economy that finds these practices more valuable than the alternative, and in direct conflict with the principle (maxim) of prosperity and wealth.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Something is systemically askew!</P> 
                                        
                                    <p>For example, if a restaurant wishes to grow, instead of cutting wages it's in their interest to pay workers well so more people can afford a meal at their restaurant.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The exploitation of natural resources and fellow humans may create an advantage for some now but is undeniably unsustainable on the whole. This circular and even Taoist relationship is lost when entities, or economies, act in isolation.</p>

                                    <p><b>The answer to our paradox cannot be found in isolation.</b></p>

                                    <P class="drop-cap">A philosophy practiced since the dawn of counting systems. <b>What is the measure of value for our economy?</b> For most it's money, right? After all, money is the universal medium we all subscribe to—a commonality for economic trade. Or is growth our measure? But growth in what? Greater inclusivity or higher profit? Sustainability or GDP? Debt or productivity?</p>

                                    <p>You get where I'm going with this. How we define and measure value sets the purpose, direction and ultimate outcome of our economy.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>Unfortunately, walls crumble in our monetary system when money itself becomes the thing that we measure—the proverbial House of Cards with money now at the top of our economic pyramid.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>As our money mutates from being <i>&ldquo;a measure of real wealth&rdquo;</i> to being <i>&ldquo;wealth itself&rdquo;</i>
                                        we disconnect from societal values such as productivity, goods and services, sustainability and equality, in favour of market defined derivatives of value, as is the case in our many financial markets today.</p>

                                       <p>Our measurement for value is now a derivative.</p>
                                                
                                    <p><b>Now, this idea may sound abstract. Trivial even.</b> After all, we live in a world where money is so synonymous with wealth that it’s not easy, if not impossible, to separate the two. As long as I can buy what I want and put some aside for savings, why care how money is used within the global monetary engine?</p>
                                                
                                    <p>But this shift is of such importance, it is the basis of 99.5% of our financial economy.
                                        It's called the commodification of money. Your interest-bearing savings account is an example. Futures, forwards, option, mortgage-backed securities, credit swaps, debt obligations are a few more examples. These practices are both systemic and prolific in our global monetary systems.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> To be clear. I am not denegrading any specific market or financial instrument.
                                        I am merely espousing that our economic imbalances find root when our system disconnects monetary value from societal values by commodifying money to place it at the top of the pyramid, above all else, as it is in many markets today.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Such a system value is an enemy to prosperity and sustainability.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Karl Polanyi, a 19th-century economist, summed up this process nicely, calling such financial instruments “Fictitious Commodities”: </p>

                                    <p><b>So whats left when the proverbial measuring stick is shaved (sold)?</b></p>
                                                
                                    <p>We are left with two competing value systems.
                                        The first, our real economy, dealing in real-world outcomes, facilitated by money.
                                        And the second, our financial economy, trading in money itself through a system of derivatives, governed by one compass only—to drive for gain.</p>
                                        
                                    <p> Where has the value of these practices come from? We cannot create something from nothing...
                                        Well, all monetary value reaped from such processes, do so at the expense of real economies.
                                        As one grows the other must falter.
                                        For one to gain, the other must be exploited.
                                        <a href="">The relationship becomes imbalanced and parasitic</a>.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>To illustrate how fundamentally disproportionate this relationship has become, as early as 1975, <a href="">over 80% of all financial transactions</a> were still linked to the trade of real goods and services, while the remaining 20% engaged in speculation. By 1997 that ratio had <a href="">dropped to 2.5%</a>. As of 2019, the number is <a href="">less than 0.5%</a>.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>This is analogous to a baker selling a loaf of bread to a customer (real economy).
                                        At the same time, 200 fictitious <i>“paper only”</i> loaves of bread are traded—<i>“risk of the bread not getting across the counter to the customer”</i>, <i>“interest on the bread while in transit”</i>, <i>“fluctuations in currencies thus affecting the relative ‘value’ of the bread”</i>...etc, etc.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>In the end everything comes back to <i>“measure vs social benefit”</i>. If our measure is not a social value, how can that measure ever add social value? <b>Or rather do these practices leverage society solely to extract a market value?</b></p>
                                                
                                    <p>Through this maxim we see an imbalanced system of measurement, perpetuating imbalances in our economy. Such a model can never create sustainable outcomes because sustainability is simply not in the equation.</p>

                                                All the money in the world cannot revive a depleted planet.

                                            In a sentence, profit, wealth consolidation, and the power that money buys. Such trading practices are immensely profitable within our financial economy but entirely detrimental to our real economy. As stated, all gains realised through non-real value systems reap value at the expense of real economies. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>As an example.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>From 1979 to 2019, our global GDP increased by <a>a total of $75 trillion</a> while global debt <a>increased by $245 trillion</a> (equating to Debt-GDP ratio rise from 31% to 322% per capita). In addition, the <a>total value of foreign exchange contracts traded exceeds these values combined</a> in just one day!</p>
                                    
                                <p>What can we deduce about such a system of money?
                                    At a minimum, we can recognise a trading structure with no real-world parallel.
                                    We can also identify a system of debt that is over-leveraged against society.
                                    And we can safely assume that such a pattern of growth is unsustainable.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Our money now flows to where it’s most profitable (or secure), not where it is most valuable, while other parts of the economy that rely on this shared resource are starved or exploited.</p>
                                    
                                                                      
                                    <p>In a world where everything is commodified, including the very money system itself, the maxim <i>“everything is more valuable than money”</i> is better expressed in a new maxim <i>“money can buy anything, so money is more valuable than everything”</i>.</p>

                                        Any system that merely rehashes the same ideologies and rules in operation today can never meet the challenges we face if we are to reach the equitable and sustainable economy we all deserve.</p>
                                    
                                                                      
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>In this, I am hopeful.</p>
                                
                                <p> I am optimistic because I believe no change is more potent for the causes of sustainability and humanitarianism than a realignment of our money flows to respect the communities in which they have derived their value from.</p>
                                    
                                <p>And in our world of emerging cryptocurrencies and globalised currencies, I believe this is not a matter of if but when.
                                    If for no other reason than the old paradigms that very devalue the purposes of money serve us no longer. </p>

                            <p class="drop-cap">Arguably no mechanism in our world has more influence over the wellbeing of our society than how we manage our money, or how it is managed for us. Wise management leads to prosperity and freedom, while mismanagement leads to stagnation and slavery.</p>

                            <p>This is something every prosperous household or business operator knows, accounting for every dollar to be put towards the values and goals of the whole. So too in an ideal world that would be the case for our global economy.</p>
                            
                            <p>But that is not the economy we live in.</p>
                            
                            <p>Human worth, our natural resources and biosphere, prosperity, sustainability, self-sufficiency, fairness, democracy, life! are all sacrificed in the relentless drive of our global economy, while those that operate our systems of money, the axis of our economy, do not behave in the best interests of everyone, but rather leverage society for their own profit and advantage.</p>
                            
                            <p>I certainly know that new money (bank loans) injected into my money supply does not profit me, nor do the many market bubbles along the way. Quite the opposite, their gain is literally my decline.</p>
                            
                            <p>It often appears we have created a system designed to work against itself. An ode to a generation (or two) who wanted to see how far the idea of free-market economics divorced from societal wellbeing could be pushed before someone said: <i>“Hold up, hold up, what you’re’ doing directly affects me!”</i>. To which the reply is first <i>“that’s just how it works”</i>, followed by <i>“Woops, we need a bailout”</i>.</p>
                            
                            <p>To me, this reflects a systemic misalignment with money, a shared resource, and humanity as a whole. To better realise our social and economic ideals, it stands to reason we need a monetary system that supports them, right?</p>
                            
                            <p>This may sound idealistic, and simplistic, but this is an idealistic and simple article, so please keep reading.</p>

                            <p>Our economic issues are not accidents, nor do I believe they are symptoms of base human nature. They are inevitable consequences from a wayward structure of management.</p>

                            <p>In this article, I want to discuss the idea of value. My goal is to illustrate, through five common-sense truths or maxims, how every economic woe we face today has its roots in misaligned value systems that are systemically perpetuated by our system of money, and the only path that leads our generation to a sustainable end is one that addresses this shortfall!</p>
                            
                            <p>Let's begin.

                                    Therefore, to increase wealth for ourselves, the earth and each other should be valued above all. <b>Paradoxically, we find value in activities that destroy and marginalise both.</b></p>
                                
                                    <p> The <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/climate-change/facts-about-climate-emergency">climate emergency</a> is on our doorstep. 
                                        Our oceans are degraded more each year from plastic and pollution.
                                        On our current trajectory, we will have <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1533125/All-seafood-will-run-out-in-2050-say-scientists.html">collapsed sustainable sea life by 2050</a>,
                                        and by the close of this century, we’ll have <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/rainforest-threats/">harvested 100% of all rainforests</a>
                                        and exterminated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/25/half-all-species-extinct-end-century-vatican-conference">over half of all species</a> on our planet.</P>

                                <P>
                                    Similarly, our economies displace workers and lower wages for efficiency, stifle innovation to protect market titans, devalue local productive activities to exploit cheaper labour across the border, and relentlessly devalue our hard work and savings by exponentially growing debt in the name of growth.</P>
                                    
                                    <p>Squeezing margins and cutting corners to maximise returns is such a reasonable philosophy within our current social and economic landscape! How often have we heard it said that it’s the fiduciary responsibility of a company to maximise shareholder wealth?</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Without vilifying any specific group or sector, we cannot escape the fact that we have perpetuated, intentionally or unwittingly, a system of economy that finds these practices more valuable than the alternative, and in direct conflict with the principle (maxim) of prosperity and wealth.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Something is askew!</P> 
                                        
                                    <p>For example, if a restaurant wishes to grow, instead of cutting wages, it's in their interest to pay workers well so more people can afford a meal at their restaurant.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The exploitation of natural resources and fellow humans may create an advantage for some now but is undeniably unsustainable on the whole. This circular and even Taoist relationship is lost when entities, or economies, act in isolation.</p>

                                    <P class="drop-cap">A philosophy practised since the dawn of counting systems, <b>what is the measure of our economy?</b> For most it's money, right? After all, money is the universal medium we all subscribe to—a commonality for economic trade. Or is growth our measure? But growth in what? Greater inclusivity or higher profit? Sustainability or GDP? Debt or productivity?</p>

                                    <p>You get where I'm going with this. How we define and measure value sets the purpose, direction and ultimate outcome of our economy.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>Unfortunately, walls crumble in our monetary system when money itself becomes the thing we measure—a proverbial House of Cards with money at the top.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Money transforms from being <i>&ldquo;a measure of real wealth&rdquo;</i> to being <i>&ldquo;wealth itself&rdquo;</i>.
                                        In the process, we distance our real societal values such as productivity, goods and services, sustainability and equality, in favour of narrowly defined market value, as is the case in our many financial markets today.</p>
                                               
                                    <p><b>Now, this idea may sound abstract, trivial even.</b> After all, we live in a world where money is so synonymous with wealth that it’s nigh impossible to separate the two.
                                        <i>“As long as I can buy what I want and put some aside for savings, why care how money is used within the global monetary engine?”</i> you may ask.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>But this shift is of such importance, it accounts for over 99% of our financial economy.
                                        It's called <b>The commodification of money</b>, a process whereby money or a derivative of money (also money) is traded on a market. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Never heard of it? Futures, forwards, option, mortgage-backed securities, credit swaps, debt obligations, to name a few.
                                        Even your interest-bearing account is such a money market. The practice is prolific in our global monetary systems.</p>

                                    <p><b>So what's left when the proverbial and ancient measuring stick called money is sold?</b></p>
                                                
                                    <p>We are left with two competing value systems.
                                        The first, our real economy, dealing in real-world outcomes governed by societal values but facilitated by money
                                        And the second, our financial economy, trading in money itself through a complex system of derivative instruments, governed by one compass only—gain.</p>
                                        
                                    <p> Where does the value of these instruments come from? After all, we cannot create something from nothing.</P>
                                        
                                    <p>In every case, monetary value is reaped at the expense of real economies, while societal values are marginalised in the process.
                                        As one grows, the other must falter.
                                        For one to gain, the other must be exploited.
                                        <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/why-growth-finance-drag-real-economy">The relationship is parasitic</a>.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>To illustrate how fundamentally disproportionate this relationship has become, as early as 1975,
                                        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/20/money-trading-economy-foreign-exchange-markets-economy">over 80% of all financial transactions</a> were still linked to the trade of real goods and services, while the remaining 20% engaged in speculation.
                                        By 1997 that ratio had dropped to 2.5%.
                                        As of 2019, the number is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-currency-is-traded-every-day-2016-9?r=US&IR=T">closer to 0.5%</a>.
                                        Keep in mind, this accounts for foreign exchange (currency) trades only. It does not include the myriad of other derivative markets competing on a similar scale.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>This is analogous to a baker selling a loaf of bread (real economy),
                                        while 200+ <i>“fictitious”</i> loaves of bread are traded—<i>“risk of the bread not getting across the counter”</i>, <i>“interest on the bread while in transit”</i>, <i>“fluctuations in currencies affecting the relative ‘value’ of the bread”</i>...etc, etc.</p>
 
                                    <p>Common sense must prevail (hopefully). If the measure is not socially oriented, how can that measure ever add social value?</p> 
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Rather, let it be seen that these practices are a leverage against society solely to extract market or monetary value.
                                        Such a model can never create sustainable outcomes because sustainability is simply not in the equation.
                                        In fact, such a value system is the mortal enemy of sustainability and prosperity. 
                                    </p>

                                                
                                    <p> And to be clear. I am not denigrating a specific market or instrument.
                                        I am merely drawing the conclusion that economic problems occur when societal values are allowed to be set aside in favour of monetary value.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>This commodification process inherently puts money at the top of the value pyramid of our economy, to feed and grow itself above all without a social or moral compass.</p>
                                                                                   

                                    <p><b>Through this maxim, we can see an unhinged system of measurement, perpetuated by misaligned money processes, that in turn perpetuate imbalances in our real economy and planet.</b></p>

                                    Are the cupboards or storehouse well stocked?
                                    Is the garden well-tended and thriving?
                                    Are the priorities of the household clearly set out?
                                    Are the finances in order? Are we in the red or the black?<br /><br />

                                    <p class="drop-cap">Said another way by Albert Einstein “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results”. </p>

                                    <p class="drop-cap"><b>What we need is a shift in thinking.</b>
                                        A departure from the old into something new.
                                        Any system that merely rehashes the same ruleless free-market cowboy ideologies in operation today can only meet more of the same. Such a path can never meet the challenges we face if we are to reach the equitable and sustainable economy we all deserve.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                                                      
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>In this shift, I am very hopeful.</p>
                                
                                <p> I am optimistic because I believe no change has more potential for the causes of sustainability and humanitarianism than a realignment of our money flows to respect the communities in which they derive their value from.</p>

                                <p>Democratic money—A collaborative standard or agreed set of rules for our money systems to behave by.
                                    Participants can share in the decision-making and benefits of expansion, while nefarious activities are eradicated for the simplest of reasons that they provide no value to that community.</p>
                                
                                <p>Such an order of money would, by its very structure, be as inversely appreciative and enriching as existing financial practices are deflationary, devaluing and socially degrading.</p>


                                <p>In our digital world of globalised currencies, emerging cryptocurrencies and open-source tech,
                                        it is not a matter of if, but when.
                                </p>

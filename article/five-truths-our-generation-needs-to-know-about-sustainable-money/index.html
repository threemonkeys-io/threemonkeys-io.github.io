                            <p class="drop-cap">Arguably no mechanism in our world has more influence over the wellbeing of our society than how we manage our money, or how it is managed for us. Wise management leads to prosperity and freedom, while mismanagement leads to stagnation and slavery.</p>

                            <p>This is something every prosperous household or business operator knows, accounting for every dollar to be put towards the values and goals of the whole. So too in an ideal world that would be the case for our global economy.</p>
                            
                            <p>But that is not the economy we live in.</p>
                            
                            <p>Human worth, our natural resources and biosphere, prosperity, sustainability, self-sufficiency, fairness, democracy, life! are all sacrificed in the relentless drive of our global economy, while those that operate our systems of money, the axis of our economy, do not behave in the best interests of everyone, but rather leverage society for their own profit and advantage.</p>
                            
                            <p>I certainly know that new money (bank loans) injected into my money supply does not profit me, nor do the many bubble-bust cycles along the way. Quite the opposite, their gain is my decline.</p>
                            
                            <p>It often appears we have created a system designed to work against itself. An ode to a generation (or two) who wanted to see how far the idea of free-market economics, divorced from societal wellbeing, could be pushed before someone said: “Hold up, hold up, what you’re’ doing directly affects me”, to which the reply is “that’s just how it works”.</p>
                            
                            <p>To me, this reflects a systemic misalignment with our money and humanity as a whole! To better realise our social and economic ideals it stands to reason we need a monetary system that supports them, right? This may sound idealistic, and simplistic, but this is an idealistic and simple article, so please keep reading.</p>
                            
                            <p>I want to take a step back from the common narrative of our economy to discuss the idea of value. My aim, through five axioms or common-sense truths, is to demonstrate how every economic woe we face today has its roots in misaligned value systems that are systemically perpetuated by our system of money.</p>


                            
                            



                            <p>Our economic issues are not accidents, nor are they symptoms of base human nature. They are inevitable consequences from a wayward structure of management, and the only path that leads our generation to a sustainable end is one that addresses the shortfall!</p>
                            
                            <p>Let's begin.

                                    Therefore, to increase wealth, the earth and each other should be valued above all. <b> Paradoxically, we find value in activities that destroy and marginalise both.</b></p>
                                
                                    <p>The climate emergency is on our doorstep. Our oceans are degraded more each year from plastic and pollution. On our current trajectory, in the next 50 years, we will destroy all sea life, and by the close of this century, we’ll have harvested 100% of all rainforests and exterminated over half of all species on our planet.</P>

                                <P>
                                    Similarly, our economies displace workers and lower wages for efficiency, stifle innovation to protect market titans, devalue local productivity to exploit cheaper labour across the border, exponentially grow debt while devaluing our savings in the name of growth.</P>
                                    
                                    <p>Squeezing margins and cutting corners to maximise returns is such a reasonable philosophy within our current social and economic landscape! How often have we heard it said that it’s the fiduciary responsibility of a company to maximise shareholder wealth?</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Without vilifying any specific group or sector, we cannot escape the fact that we have perpetuated, intentionally or unwittingly, a system of economy that finds these practices more valuable than the alternative, and in direct conflict with the principle (axiom) of prosperity and wealth!</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Something is systemically askew. For example, if a restaurant wants more customers, then it's in their interest to pay workers well so that more people can afford a meal at their restaurant!</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The exploitation of natural resources and fellow humans may create an advantage for some now but is undeniably unsustainable on the whole and in the long-run. This circular and even Taoist yin-yang relationship is lost when entities, or economies, act in isolation.</p>

                                    <p>The answer to our paradox cannot be found in isolation.</p>

                                                What is the measure of success for our economy?</b> Obviously money, right? After all, money is the universal medium we all subscribe to. A commonality for economic cooperation! Or is growth our measure? But growth in what? Greater inclusivity or higher profit? Sustainability or GDP? Debt or productivity?</p>

                                        <p>You get where I'm going with this. How we define and measure value sets the purpose, direction and ultimate outcome of our economy.</p>
                                                
                                        <p>Our lines blur however when money itself becomes the thing that we measure, as is the trading practices of our many financial markets today. In such a system, real (social) values such as goods and services, productivity, sustainability, equality, takes second fiddle to monetary or derivative values; Debt, interest, yields, risk, volatility, speculation, time and future potential.</p>
                                                
                                        <p>Money mutates from being <i>&ldquo;a measure for real wealth&rdquo;</i> to being <i>&ldquo;wealth itself&rdquo;</i>, thus progressing to the top of the value pyramid of our economy, to serve and propagate itself above everything real and tangible in our society—In this process, our measure of value becomes distorted and disconnected from society.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>Now, this idea may sound abstract, trivial even. After all, we live in a world where money is so synonymous with wealth that it’s not easy, if not impossible, to separate the two. As long as I can buy what I want and put some aside for savings, why care how money is used within the global monetary engine?</p>
                                                
                                    <p>But this shift is of such importance, it is the basis of 99.5% of our financial economy. It is called the commodification of money. Your interest-bearing savings account is a simple such example, a money market of sorts. Futures, mortgage-backed securities, credit swaps, options, debt obligations are a few more examples. The practice is both systemic and prolific in our global monetary systems.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>Karl Polanyi, a 19th-century economist, summed up this process nicely, calling such financial instruments “Fictitious Commodities”: </p>
                                        

                                    <blockquote class="text-center quote-post m-bot-50">
                                            <p>When these ‘fictitious commodities are treated as if they are commodities produced for sale on the market, rather than protected rights, our social world is endangered, and major crises will ensue.</p>

                                    <p>So what do we get when the proverbial measuring stick is shaved (sold)?</p>
                                                
                                    <p>We are left with two competing value systems. The first, our real economy, dealing in the production and consumption of all goods and services, facilitated by money, and the second, our financial economy, trading in money itself through a complex system of derivatives for the sole purpose of extracting value from the real economy through the creation of monetary or market value, but ultimately disconnected from any societal needs or value-add.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>As one grows the other must falter. For one to gain, the other must be exploited. The relationship becomes imbalance and parasitic!</p>
                                                
                                    <p>To illustrate how fundamentally disproportionate this relationship has become, as early as 1975, over 80% of all financial transactions were still linked to the trade of real goods and services, while the remaining 20% engaged in speculation. By 1997 that ratio had dropped to 2.5%. As of 2019, the number is less than 0.5%.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>This is analogous to a baker selling one loaf of bread to a customer (real economy). At the same time, financial institutions trade 200 fictitious “paper only” loaves of bread - “risk of the bread not getting across the counter to the customer”, “interest on the bread while in transit”, “fluctuations in currencies thus affecting the relative ‘value’ of the bread”...and so on and so on.</p>
                                                
                                    <p>Ultimately, everything comes back to “measure vs social benefit”. If our measure for value is not a social value in any way, how can that measure ever add social value? or rather does it leverage society to extract monetary or market value instead? Does it add to, or does it take away? It is undeniably the latter. </p>
                                                
                                                
                                    <p>Through this axiom we see an imbalanced system of measurement, perpetuating an imbalanced economy. Such a mode of operation can never create sustainable outcomes because sustainability is simply not in the equation.</p>

Such trading practices are immensely profitable within our financial economy but entirely detrimental to our real economy. All profits realised through such practices are reaped at the expense of the real economy. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>For example.</p>

In addition, the total value of foreign exchange contracts traded exceeds these values combined in one day!</p>
                                    
                                <p>What can we deduce about such a system of money? At a minimum, we can recognise a trading structure with no real-world parallel, we can identify a system of debt that is over-leveraged against society, and we can safely assume that such a pattern of growth is unsustainable.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Our money now flows to where it’s most profitable, not where it is most valuable, while other parts of the economy that rely on this shared resource are starved or exploited.</p>

So what outcomes can we expect from a system with conflicting values? This is no particular order, nor is it a definitive list:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Natural resources are exploited, gobbled up by massive money flows seeking more and more returns on relatively less and less resources.</li>

                                        <li>Humankind is marginalised, valuable only for labour contributions.</li>
                                        <li>Debt, the money creation process, over leverages our future and planet.</li>
                                        <li>Inflation and devalued currencies as money is disconnected from production.</li>
                                        <li>Consolidation of wealth and power is a natural outcome. The whole financial economy is, in essence, a wealth consolidation machine.</li>
                                        <li>Inequality and exclusion.</li>
                                        <li>Inflated Asset Prices and market boom-bubble-bust cycles.</li>
